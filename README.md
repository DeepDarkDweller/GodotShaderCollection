# GodotShaderCollection
This is a collection of some shaders that I made while developing my game that seemed useful enough to share

## SLIPGATE
Warps the texture UVs in world space or screen space. My attempt to recreate the slipgate from Quake

## Text Alpha Bias
Allows you to force partially transparent pixels to be either more or less transparent. Originally I was using this because I couldn't disable anti-aliasing on TTFs but I eventually discovered that the option did in fact exist. However, this can still be useful if you want to make TTFs look weird I guess.
